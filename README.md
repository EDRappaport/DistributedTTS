Protocols for Client and Server Performing Distributed Text to Speech Algorithm 

The freetts folder is included for reference.
The folder which is needed for the algorithm is the src/com folder. To use it's classes, we just need to import com.sun.speech.... as seen in the demos which I included in the src/project folder. 
These are the files which we will be editing to fit our needs.
